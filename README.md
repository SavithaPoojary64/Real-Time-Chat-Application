# Real-Time-Chat-Application
Real time Chat App  using Websockets (Node.js, Express & Socket.io)
We have created a real-time chat application using Express and Websockets. Instead of using plain Websockets, we've opted for a library called Socket.io. Socket.io simplifies the process of using Websockets and offers a fallback mechanism to XHR requests until the Websocket connection is established.
